# Description

This is a repository of the code for the ***An efficient projection neural network for â„“<sub>1</sub>-regularized logistic regression*** paper.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3.6+
* PyTorch 1.6+
* sklearn 0.23
* Matplotlib (for graphs and figures)

### Installing

* Download repository
* Install Dependencies
* Datasets must be in Libsvm format, download and put them in the [datasets](./datasets) folder in the root of the project. Download link available in the **Acknowledgments**.
    
### Executing program

* Run each file in form of `run_(dataset_name).py` to obtain corresponding results of the proposed method and sklearn LogisticRegression model

* Run each file in form of `script_(figure's_name).py` to generate the paper's figures

* **Note:** Results that acquired from all methods available in .mat format in the [results folder](./results).
